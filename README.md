# KSH SmartOps

## Overview
KSH SmartOps is a warehouse operations intelligence platform built to analyze and visualize warehouse operational data that is traditionally maintained in Excel files.  

The goal of this project is to convert manual, static Excel-based reporting into an interactive system that supports data-driven decision-making for warehouse managers.

This project is being developed as a hands-on, end-to-end learning project using the MERN stack along with data analytics and basic machine learning concepts.

## Problem Statement
Warehouse operational data such as overtime (OT), approvals, customer-wise activity, and productivity is commonly tracked in Excel.  
While functional, this approach has several limitations:
- Manual report preparation
- Limited analytics and trend visibility
- No centralized system for analysis
- Difficult to scale across warehouses

---

## Project Objectives
- Ingest warehouse operational data from Excel/CSV files
- Store and manage data in a structured database
- Provide interactive dashboards and filters
- Perform analytical aggregations for insights
- Add basic trend prediction for planning support

---

## Planned Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Data Analytics & ML:** Python (Pandas, basic time-series models)
- **Visualization:** Chart libraries (Recharts / Chart.js)

## Project Status
🚧 Initial setup and architecture planning in progress.
